# Operation-Hope-Website

What the Website is:
	This website is for the church/neighborhood ministry that I go to. It covers what it’s about and what it does, along with a story of the day. However, I didn’t have anything specific to put in the story of the day section, so I improvised.   
 
How I Chose My Website:
My church has needed an updated website for a while now, so I simply decided to fill that need.

Design:
 	They didn’t really give me any specifics, and design isn’t really my strong suit, so I spent some time looking at modern websites and tried my best to do what they did. I only had the basics of HTML and CSS to work with, so websites like stackoverflow and w3schools helped me a lot along the way. I decided to make a slideshow for the main page and just put a single image on all the other pages because I didn’t have enough pictures to put a slideshow on every page.

Most Difficult Problems:
	The three most difficult problems that I had was the slideshow, the color scheme and font, and also the hamburger nav bar. The slideshow was difficult because I have no experience with JavaScript and I pretty much had to copy paste a slideshow from w3schools. However, I learned a lot about how JavaScript functions while I was studying the slideshow that I got. The second problem that I had with the website was the color scheme and font. I am what you would consider creatively challenged. I have a hard time choosing color schemes and fonts that actually look good. I enjoy the actual coding and watching the website take form in front of my eyes. I settled with googling color schemes and choosing the one that looked the best to me. The most difficult problem by far was the hamburger nav bar. One of the functions that I really wanted the website to have was a button to make the navbar appear and disappear. I had the same problem with JavaScript as the slideshow. I didn’t know much about it and and it is nearly impossible to integrate to an existing website without starting from scratch. It took near 2 months to solve and on the last day of design, I got the idea.  I made a duplicate file for each page. One with a navbar and one without. I also added a button the essentially made a loop. If you were on the page with the navbar and clicked the button, it would take you to the page without one. It created a problem with the back arrow, but it was the best thing i could come up with. This was one of the most satisfying problem solving I have ever done. One of the most enjoyable things about coding a website is to want something done and to put in the work to get it done.
