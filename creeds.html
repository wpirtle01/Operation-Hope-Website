  <p id="creed">
WE BELIEVE THAT:
All children are special and a gift from God
All children have a God given destiny and purpose in life
All children have special gifts and talents that makes them unique
All children through Jesus Christ have the ability to succeed
Through love, encouragement and discipline our children will find their destiny
All children deserve an opportunity to succeed regardless of economic, social, cultural or individual barriers
There are no problem children only children with problems and problems can be solved
All children need someone to believe in them, and we will be that someone
Our lives should be an example our children can and would wan to follow
We are producing a generation of young people who love God and will change their community by having a positive impact on it.
